# Mastermind Game

This is a step-by-step tutorial project from Jumpstart Lab. It's a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).


## Pre-project thoughts

The goal of this project is to learn how to:

- manipulate file input and output
- read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
- transform it into a standardized format
- utilize the data to contact a remote service
- populate a template with user data
- manipulate strings
- access Google's Civic Information API through the Google API Client Gem
- use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating


## Post-project thoughts

I now understand better how data from external files can be accessed with an API, and manipulated and made more useful using Ruby.

One idea for a future project is to use this knowledge to download my personal banking data (in csv format) and create a user-friendly overview of my expenses (something my current bank isn't very good at).
